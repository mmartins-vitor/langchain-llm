# Build a simple LLM application with chat models and prompt templates

In this quickstart we’ll show you how to build a simple LLM application with LangChain. This application will translate text from English into another language. This is a relatively simple LLM application - it’s just a single LLM call plus some prompting. Still, this is a great way to get started with LangChain - a lot of features can be built with just some prompting and an LLM call!

After reading this tutorial, you’ll have a high level overview of:

- Using language models

- Using prompt templates

- Debugging and tracing your application using LangSmith

## Installation

`npm i langchain @langchain/core`
